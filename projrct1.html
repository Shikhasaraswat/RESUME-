    <h2>ENGINEERING PROJECT IN COMMUNITY SERVICES</h2>
    <p>Objective
        1. To find a solution to a significant problem silent assault <br>
        2. Having a better healthcare facility is a priority. <br>
        3. Fast and remote healthcare monitoring is now possible. <br>
        4. Create a user-friendly method to ensure that the healthcare system is fair.We're developing an AI model that acts as a biomarker sensor, detecting serious problems
        such as silent heart attacks via saliva and heart rate.</p>

        <p>We're have made an AI-based biomarker sensor that can detect silent coronary artery
            disease using a person's saliva and heartbeat.
            We also provide an online and app option for a faster and more convenient experience.</p>
        <p> For the user, we also have a web and app option that makes it easier and more informative.
            It uses electronics to collect all essential inputs from the user, such as saliva and heartbeat.
            The device then uses biomarker sensors to process the data as needed, and finally provides
            the measured outputs to the web/app.
             The web/app then analyses these output data using software-defined thresholds for various
            types of measured quantities.</p>
            <p>COMPONENTS USED <BR></BR>
                Heart Beat Sensor <br>
                The Arduino Uno <br>
                Pulse Sensor <br>
                NodeMCU ESP 8266 <br>
                Salivary Sensor
            </p>
            <p>Outcomes -
                Salivary BNP was found in both the control group and the HF patients.
                In symptomatic HF patients, salivary BNP levels were considerably higher. BNP levels
               decreased as symptoms improved.
                We were able to distinguish HF patients in the decompensated phase based on the level of
               BNP in their saliva, and lower levels of BNP were linked to improved symptoms and less
               congestion. <br> <br>
               Results -
               Patients with HF had greater salivary BNP levels than the control group, although the values were
               considerably higher in the admitted HF group.</p>
